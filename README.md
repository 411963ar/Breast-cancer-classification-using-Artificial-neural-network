# Breast-cancer-classification-using-Artificial-neural-network-Deeplearning Project
The model is trained to predict cancer classes as either benign or malignant using prestored dataset from scikit learn library,the model is trained upto 10 epochs through which the accuracy of 97% was achieved with the loss reduced to  0.1119
